Welcome to my SWAPI Project! 
I created this project using html, CSS, javasctipt and fetched data from an external API called SWAPI. 
For this project I fetched data from the people and film categories and displayed their data on two pages. 
The buttons on the pages act as navigation links to lead you to another page and also to show the data displayed from the API.
